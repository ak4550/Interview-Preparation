## React Interview Questions and Answers
#### 1. **What is React?**
**Answer:** React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.
The important features of React are:
- It supports server-side rendering.
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

#### 2. **What are the advantages of using React?**
**Answer:** MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.
- **Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency:** React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
- **Gentle learning curve:** React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.
- **SEO friendly:** React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.
- **Reusable components:** React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.
- **Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from:** React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement.

#### 3. **What are the limitations of React?**
**Answer:** The few limitations of React are as given below:
- React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
- The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.
- It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
- Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.

#### 4. **What are the limitations of React?**
**Answer:** The few limitations of React are as given below:
[!React List](react-list.png)
Example of a list using key:
```
const ids = [1,2,3,4,5];
const listElements = ids.map((id)=>{
return(
<li key={id.toString()}>
  {id}
</li>
)
})
```
**Importance of keys -**
- Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
- Keys should be given to array elements for providing a unique identity for each element.
- Without keys, React does not understand the order or uniqueness of each element.
- With keys, React has an idea of which particular element was deleted, edited, and added.
- Keys are generally used for displaying a list of data coming from an API.

> Note- Keys used within arrays should be unique among siblings. They need not be globally unique.

#### 5. **What is JSX?**
**Answer:** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.
> Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.
Let’s understand how JSX works:
Without using JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process:
```
const text = React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a text');
const container = React.createElement('div','{}',text );
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);
```
Using JSX, the above code can be simplified:
```
const container = (
<div>
  <p>This is a text</p>
</div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);
```
As one can see in the code above, we are directly using HTML inside JavaScript.

#### 6. **What are the differences between functional and class components?**
**Answer:** Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.

Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ.

On the following basis let’s compare functional and class components:

- **Declaration**
Functional components are nothing but JavaScript functions and therefore can be declared using an arrow function or the function keyword:
```
function card(props){
   return(
      <div className="main-container">
        <h2>Title of the card</h2>
      </div>
    )
   }
   const card = (props) =>{
    return(
      <div className="main-container">
        <h2>Title of the card</h2>
      </div>
    )
   }
```
Class components, on the other hand, are declared using the ES6 class:
```
class Card extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
     super(props);
   }
    render(){
      return(
        <div className="main-container">
          <h2>Title of the card</h2>
        </div>
      )
    }
   }
```

- **Handling props**
Let’s render the following component with props and analyse how functional and class components handle props:
> &lt;Student Info name="Vivek" rollNumber="23" /&gt;
In functional components, the handling of props is pretty straightforward. Any prop provided as an argument to a functional component can be directly used inside HTML elements:
```
function StudentInfo(props){
   return(
     <div className="main">
       <h2>{props.name}</h2>
       <h4>{props.rollNumber}</h4>
     </div>
   )
 }
```
In the case of class components, props are handled in a different way:
```
class StudentInfo extends React.Component{
   constructor(props){
     super(props);
    }
    render(){
      return(
        <div className="main">
          <h2>{this.props.name}</h2>
          <h4>{this.props.rollNumber}</h4> 
        </div>
      )
    }
   }
```
As we can see in the code above, this keyword is used in the case of class components.

- **Handling state**
Functional components use React hooks to handle state. It uses the useState hook to set the state of a variable inside the component:
```
function ClassRoom(props){
   let [studentsCount,setStudentsCount] = useState(0);
    const addStudent = () => {
      setStudentsCount(++studentsCount);
   }
    return(
      <div>
        <p>Number of students in class room: {studentsCount}</p>
        <button onClick={addStudent}>Add Student</button>
      </div>
    )
   }
```
Since useState hook returns an array of two items, the first item contains the current state, and the second item is a function used to update the state.

In the code above, using array destructuring we have set the variable name to studentsCount with a current value of “0” and setStudentsCount is the function that is used to update the state.

For reading the state, we can see from the code above, the variable name can be directly used to read the current state of the variable.

We cannot use React Hooks inside class components, therefore state handling is done very differently in a class component:

Let’s take the same above example and convert it into a class component:
```
class ClassRoom extends React.Component{
        constructor(props){
            super(props);
            this.state = {studentsCount : 0};
            
            this.addStudent = this.addStudent.bind(this);
         }
            
            addStudent(){
            this.setState((prevState)=>{
               return {studentsCount: prevState.studentsCount++}
            });
         }
            
            render(){
             return(
               <div>
                 <p>Number of students in class room: {this.state.studentsCount}</p>
                 <button onClick={this.addStudent}>Add Student</button>
               </div>
             )
           }
         } 
```
In the code above, we see we are using this.state to add the variable studentsCount and setting the value to “0”.

For reading the state, we are using this.state.studentsCount.

For updating the state, we need to first bind the addStudent function to this. Only then, we will be able to use the setState function which is used to update the state.
